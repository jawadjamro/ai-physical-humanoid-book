# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of our comprehensive guide to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the nervous system for humanoid robot control.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Nodes, Topics, Services, Parameters)
- Explain how Python-based Agents communicate with ROS 2 controllers using rclpy
- Describe practical examples of ROS 2 message flow
- Create a beginner-friendly URDF example for a simple humanoid structure
- Create a basic ROS 2 package and understand message passing

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command line interfaces

## Module Overview

ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to provide the infrastructure needed for developing robot applications. It addresses the limitations of ROS 1 and provides improved security, real-time performance, and better cross-platform support.

In this module, we'll explore how ROS 2 serves as the middleware for humanoid robot control, covering the essential communication patterns and practical applications that will form the foundation for your work with humanoid robots.
