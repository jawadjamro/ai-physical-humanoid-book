# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of our comprehensive guide to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This module focuses on digital twin technology, specifically using Gazebo and Unity for physics simulation, sensor modeling, and high-fidelity rendering of humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of digital twins in robotics
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create Unity-based robot simulations with high-fidelity rendering
- Model sensors and physics properties for accurate simulation
- Integrate simulated robots with ROS 2 for testing and development

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (from Module 1)
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts
- Basic programming knowledge (Python/C++)

## Module Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors its properties, states, and behaviors in real-time. In robotics, digital twins serve as crucial tools for testing, validation, and development before deploying systems on real hardware.

This module covers two major simulation platforms:
- **Gazebo**: A physics-based simulation environment with accurate collision detection and sensor modeling
- **Unity**: A high-fidelity rendering platform for visualization and user interaction

Both platforms can be integrated with ROS 2 to create comprehensive simulation environments for humanoid robots.
