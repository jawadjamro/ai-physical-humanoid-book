# Unified AI/Robotics Book: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational resource on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book covers everything from ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced AI integration for humanoid robots.

## Book Structure

This book is organized into 5 comprehensive modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1-ros2/intro)
Learn the foundational concepts of ROS 2, including Nodes, Topics, Services, and how Python-based Agents communicate with ROS 2 controllers using rclpy.

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2-gazebo/intro)
Explore physics simulation, sensors, collisions, and high-fidelity rendering using Gazebo and Unity for creating accurate digital twins of humanoid robots.

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](/docs/module-3-isaac/intro)
Dive into synthetic data generation, Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM), perception algorithms, and path planning with NVIDIA Isaac.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/module-4-vla/intro)
Combine vision, language, and action for autonomous robot behavior, including cognitive planning with LLMs and ROS 2 action sequencing.

### [Module 5: Capstone - Autonomous Humanoid Robot](/docs/module-5-capstone/intro)
Implement a complete autonomous humanoid robot system that receives voice commands, plans actions, navigates, perceives objects, and manipulates them.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Students learning Physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Developers working with ROS 2 and AI integration
- Researchers in embodied intelligence and robotics
- Engineers building autonomous robotic systems

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1-ros2/intro) to build a solid foundation before progressing to more advanced topics.
