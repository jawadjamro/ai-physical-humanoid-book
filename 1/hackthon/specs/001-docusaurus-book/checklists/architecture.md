**Purpose**: Validate plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task breakdown
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md](../plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details leak into architecture (abstractions only)
- [x] Focused on system design and component relationships
- [x] Written for technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Architecture Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Architecture decisions are justified with trade-offs
- [x] Technical requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Implementation approach is clear and actionable
- [x] All key decisions are documented
- [x] Dependencies and constraints identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Assumptions are documented

## Architecture Readiness

- [x] All architectural requirements have clear success criteria
- [x] Component interactions are defined
- [x] System meets measurable outcomes defined in Implementation Approach
- [x] Architecture supports functional requirements from spec

## Notes

- All planning requirements have been validated and meet quality standards
- Ready to proceed to task breakdown phase
